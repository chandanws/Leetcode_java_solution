leetcode solutions in java

this is my 2nd time working on leetcode. the versions indicate the number
of submissions i made before being accepted. be **cautious** that usually
only the last commit contains the accepted answer. other ones are either 
not efficient enough or not bug-free. some commit messages contain details
of the bugs i made in earlier versions.
